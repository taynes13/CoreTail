# ROADMAP

## PHASE 1 - MVP 
(opening 1 file)

* watching file:
  * when appending file in notepad, it does not work properly (duplicates empty lines) - unit test?
  * data virtualization?
* follow on/off
  * throttle auto-scrolling?
* look & feel
  * light/dark theme
  * better drag over file indications
* UWP specific
  * 2nd share into the same instance is very slow (explorer.exe hangs for several seconds)
* Avalonia specific
  * drag'n'drop open once it is supported by platform
* housekeeping
  * build server

## PHASE 2 - matching BareTail
(tabs, filters, search, ...)

* multiple files (tabs)
  * update drag'n'drop

## PHASE 3 - be the best
