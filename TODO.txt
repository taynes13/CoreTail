# ROADMAP

## PHASE 1 - MVP 
(opening 1 file)

* drag'n'drop open
* watching file:
  * batch reading instead of line by line (initial load of large file freezes)
  * when appending file in notepad, it does not work properly (duplicates empty lines)
  * data virtualization?
* follow on/off
  * throttle auto-scrolling?
* look & feel
  * light/dark theme
* UWP specific
  * 2nd share into the same instance does not work

## PHASE 2 - matching BareTail
(tabs, filters, search, ...)

* multiple files (tabs)

## PHASE 3 - be the best
